                                            A key agent of unethical web design is the <strong>dark pattern</strong> - a design pattern which deliberately deceives, manipulates or forces a user into performing an action that benefits the platform, but not necessarily the user.

                                        Design interventions and design patterns are very similar, only differing in their level of formality and means of documentation. Design patterns are established, working solutions to a design problem; they are given unique names and are very often tried and tested solutions. Design interventions on the other hand,
                                        need not be verified - they simply represent any design decision throughout the course of the design process that is intended to elicit a specific response from the user. The purpose of documenting design interventions is to identify potential areas where they are unethical, or cause poor usability, whereas design patterns
                                        are documented in order to provide guidance to other designers.

                                    <p>
                                        Dark patterns are a specific kind of design patterns that are always unethical. The term "dark pattern" was coined in 2010 by UX specialist Harry Brignull, 
                                        to describe a growing phenomena of malicious and deceptive web interfaces, which exploited specific aspects of human psychology and perception to achieve business goals. Fundamentally, it is not unethical to boost KPIs and ensure a platform is economically viable, but doing so <strong>must never come at the expense of the site's usability or the user's wellbeing.</strong> Dark patterns do precisely this.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 id = "item-12"> Why are They Used?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite being so controversial, dark patterns are present in even the most reputable of websites - platforms such as Facebook, Amazon and Google are notable examples, with privacy dark patterns being common to Facebook in particular. This begs the question - why are dark patterns so popular? This is no simple question, but the most significant reason relates to their effectiveness; dark patterns, despite yielding few long term benefits
                                        for platforms, are very good at boosting KPIs such as conversion rates in the short term. If an interface is designed to deceive users into performing some action, it is expected that more users will perform said action on average. As such, platforms looking for short term economic boosts may turn to dark patterns as a means to gain revenue. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Furthermore, over relying on data driven methods such as A/B testing to evaluate the quality of websites may also lead to the prevelance of dark patterns. If the only metrics by which you measure the quality of a particular design are KPI-based then naturally, designs that employ dark patterns will outperform more ethical alternatives. As such, designs may gradually evolve towards implementing more and more dark patterns as a result of a 
                                        testing process which favours short term boosts to conversion rates over long term user satisfaction. As such, it is necessary to consider live usability testing with real users alongside quantitative methods, such that use reactions to a particular design intervention can be measured holistically. This links in heavily with the principle of non-instrumentalism, and harbouring a regard for the user's experience and wellbeing as they use the interface.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While dark patterns boost revenue in the short term, they fail in the long term as they correlate with lower user satisfaction. As such, any benefits garnered by dark patterns in the short term are lost in the long term, as customers lose faith in the platform. Similarly, dark patterns, particularly in e-commerce often result in customers having to phone customer support to process refunds and other queries - this comes with a cost of its own. 
                                        The ELVA framework posits that avoiding dark patterns is instrumental to maintaining an ethical website that promotes long-term user loyalty.

                                        Dark patterns are intentional, and supplant the value of users in pursuit of financial gain. This guide identifies 15 in total which can be taxonomised according to the following five categories: sneaking, misdirection, restriction, urgency and social proof, and this chapter will give a description of each.

                                        The first type of dark patterns to be discussed are <strong>sneaking patterns</strong> which primarily operate by performing actions on behalf of the user without informing them, or hiding/delaying costs or stipulations such that the user is not aware of their presence. There are four dark patterns which fall into the category of sneaking, and all of these involve sneaking costs or stipulations past the user in some way.
                                    </p>
                                    <ol class = "example-content list-eg">
                                        <li> <strong>Sneak into Basket:</strong> This pattern involves quietly adding an item to the user's basket without receiving explicit consent beforehand. This will sometimes not be made visible until the very last stage of checkout, and can result in concrete financial loss for the user if they do not realise the item has been added.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hidden Costs:</strong> The hidden costs dark pattern involves revealing previously undisclosed charges to the user immediately before they check out. Since the user has almost completed their task, they are likely to accept the charge for fear of wasting time and effort by cancelling the purchase. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Hidden Subscription:</strong> This involves charging users a recurring fee for a subscription presented as incurring a one-time cost. The user will possibly not realise they are being charged on a monthly basis, as they will have signed up under the assumption that the cost is one-off.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hidden Stipulations:</strong> Involves hiding important details or stipulations which are likely to affect a user's decisions (such as costs and privacy implications) in lengthy prose text blocks, with the intention of making the information more difficult for the user to locate.</li>

                                        Dark patterns classed under <strong>misdirection</strong> involve manipulating users into choosing certain options over others, using the visual presentation, language and structure of one or several pages. Generally, misdirection focuses the user's attention on one action possibility while concealing or distracting them from others.
                                    </p>

                                        <li> <strong>Confirmshaming:</strong> The confirmshaming dark pattern involves using emotionally charged or manipulative language to persuade the user to select one option over another. The aim is to associate shame or guilt with the option that does not benefit the platform such that the user avoids it.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Trick Questions:</strong> This pattern uses deliberately unclear, perplexing or ambiguous language to attempt to confuse a user into selecting one option over another - for instance, using double negatives to confuse the user into opting into cookies.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Bad Defaults:</strong> Involves preselecting options for the user that streamline business goals, rather than the user's goals. Usually, the options preselected are those that result in the user spending more money or relinquishing more data than they otherwise would have.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Visual Interference:</strong> This uses the visual presentation (size, colour, shape, positioning, icons) of a webpage to steer users towards a particular choice. Commonly, these dark patterns impose an unfair sense of hierarchy on options which should otherwise be treated as equal.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                </div>

                                        Restrictive dark patterns operate by limiting the range of availible action possibilites that a user can take, with the intention of forcing them to select some action that benefits the platform. They also make it disproportionately difficult for users to identify and perform certain action possibilities over others.

                                        <li> <strong>Hard to Cancel/Delete:</strong> These dark patterns make the process of signing up for an account or subscription significantly easier than the process of deleting the account or unsubscribing. Often, the latter is made deliberately more difficult, to restrict the user into keeping the account/subscription. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Forced Action:</strong> Forced actions are tangential, or otherwise unecessary actions that the user is forced to complete in order to realise their aims on a website. This includes signing up for an account, connecting social media or subscribing to newsletters. </li>
                                        <li><strong>Hard to Change:</strong> Refers to any dark pattern which makes it unecessarily difficult for users to change default settings.</li>

                                        Dark patterns classed under urgency seek to artificially accelerate the decision making process of users by creating a false sense of urgency or scarcity. Often, this is done using deceptive information and can induce panic in users.

                                        The final class of dark pattern to be discussed is <strong>social proof</strong>: using information about the actions of other users to persuade a user into performing the same action. Generally, social proof is a persuasive tehcnique which leverages the bandwagon effect to achieve its aims and is not fundamentally unethical. However, when the information provided to users is vague or even deceptive, social proof techniques constitute a dark pattern,
