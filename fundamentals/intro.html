                                                Often, it is not entire websites or even pages that are unethical, but specific components. It is prudent to separate an interface into its main design components, 
                                                understanding how they operate both individually and together, before conducting an ethical review. This ensures granularity and detail.

                                            A web interface can be deconstructed into distinct groups of UI elements which work together to serve a common purpose. 
                                            A UI element can be thought of as a basic graphical widget on a webpage, such as a button, heading or paragraph block.
                                            It is not these elements in isolation that create interaction experiences, but their organisation and structure. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The sizing, colour, shape and placement of not only individual,  
                                            but groups of interacting UI elements can be used to persuade, dissuade and otherwise influence user behaviour. This is referred to in this guide as a <strong>design intervention</strong>, 
                                            a type of design component that is made with the goal of inducing a specific behavioural response from users.  Design interventions may consist of several sub-interventions, which operate together
                                            to produce the desired response from a user. The concept of a design intervention combines a graphics oriented approach with a user-centered model of assessing how particular groups of
                                            UI elements affect an interaction experience. As such, design interventions may perhaps be thought of as <strong>UX elements.</strong>

                                            is ethical or not depends on a range of factors, some of which will be discussed in this section. Reviewing a design intervention can be conducted formatively, during the design process or summatively, as an evaluative strategy.

                                            It is easiest to decompose an interface on a page-by-page basis, starting with the top-level UI elements and working inwards. Elements such as navigational bars, headers and
                                            menus can generally be identified and documented first - naturally, when analysing a top-level intervention, its sub-interventions will also be identified. The image below shows 
                                            a sample product page for a bookstore, with the top-level design interventions annotated with numbers.

                                        <p> Each element in the list above is a top level level design intervention. They involve organising graphical UI elements in such a way that serves a particular purpose, whether it be to
                                            showcase products or allow the user to navigate to different pages of the site. Of course,
                                            it is possible to deconstruct the interventions further, and yield a number of sub-interventions that contribute to its goal. This demonstrated by the site's navigation bar - there are three key 
                                            sub-interventions operating within the navbar, each serving a specific purpose which contributes to the overarching goal of providing sufficient site-wide navigation.
                                        </p>
                                        <div class = "figure">

                                            <ol class = "mx-auto annotations" style = "width:93%">
                                                <li><strong>Home Icon:</strong> Universally recognisable home icon, navigates the user to the site homepage when clicked. </li>
                                                <li><strong>Page Links: </strong> Inline list of page links, indicates which pages the user can navigate to from the homepage and allows them to do so.   </li>
                                                <li><strong>Basket Icon: </strong> Small image of a shopping cart, indicating the number of products the user has added to their cart. Allows users to view their cart </li>

                                            Clearly, the design of this navigational bar is not random. The text links are grouped together nearer to the center, with the home and basket icons occupying the far left and right ends of the bar
                                            respectively. This is a logical grouping, making it easier for users to locate the links they need. Similarly, the number in the cart is coloured red, to distinguish it from the rest of the icon and ensure
                                            its meaning is unambiguous. Wherever we look on a website, there are deliberate design decisions which can either help the user, or in the case of anti-patterns and dark patterns - hinder them.

                                        <p> The above descriptions for each design intervention are very simple. For the purposes of quickly noting them down, this simplicitly suffices but if we are to conduct a formal ethical review
                                            of a design intervention, it is necessary to document it more thoroughly. Design interventions can be documented in terms of their <strong>motivations, methods and outcomes</strong>.
                                        </p>
                                        <img class = "img-fluid" id= "inline-image" src ="../images/intro/mmo.png">

                                            Motivation, method and outcome can be thought of as the <em>why, how and what</em> of a design intervention. The why deals with the underlying motives behind the design and its goals, while the how considers the practical means
                                            by which it is implemented - that is, how specific UI elements are used to realise the goal of the intervention. Lastly, the outcomes refer to the intended and unintended consequences of the intervention, including the 
                                            user's response and its effects on both the user and the system. Below is a framework for deconstructing design interventions according to these three categories.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Motivations refer to the reason behind an intervention's existence or the business need that it serves, and are established before the design is implemented or prototyped. Motivations are markedly different to outcomes, which can only be realised once an 
                                            intervention has been implemented - motivations are frequently tied to specific, measurable goals such as increasing conversion rates and sales, or may target a specific usability issue.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Motivations can be understood in terms of a problem statement and an action. The problem statement refers to the particular issue that warrants a design intervention, and the action refers to the intended result of the intervention across the entire user-base.
                                            If applicable, design motivations may also include a risk factor, if it is likely to yield an intervention that will affect user's data, money or emotional constitution.

                                                    A motivation is said to possess a risk factor if its action is likely to involve: directly or indirectly increasing the amount of data or money relinquished by users or directly and significantly altering the user's psychological constitution. 
                                                        A user's psychological constitution is said to be significantly altered if they experience, as a direct result of the intervention, heightened states of: stress, anxiety, confusion, frustration, guilt  or disappointment.

                                            Documenting motivations requires a certain amount of looking ahead. While the intervention may not be fully designed, nor should it be at this stage, it is still possible to extract the key features that it is likely to involve from it's motivation alone.
                                            Below is an example of a motivation which if developed, may yield a persuasive design intervention.

                                            Once an intervention is fully scoped and understood, it is possible to consider how it is to be implemented. The method of a design intervention refers to how specific UI elements are used to realise the desired effect, and takes into account any psychological or perceptive factors
                                            which are used to implement it. The method of a design intervention may include factors such as the positioning and size of UI elements and the point at which they are shown to the user. A more detailed list of potential methods
                                            is shown below.

                                                        Carefully tailoring language, wording or imagery to induce a particular emotional response.

                                                        This can be done situationally, temporally or by combining the two.

For instance, displaying a popup 1 second after the user hovers their mouse over an element is temporal control.

                                            Documenting methods is generally an easier endeavour than documenting motivations, as it simply involves a description of how the intervention has already been implemented.

                                            Designers must consider, within reason, all predictable outcomes that may arise from a user interacting with an intervention. This is very challenging, as it requires simulating the user's thought process
                                            and predicting their likely courses of action. Here, the principle of non-instrumentalism applies, as it necessitates a thorough approach to user testing which yields a diverse set of outcomes. Outcomes should be
                                            described in terms of four main points, described below.

                                                        Any actions that the user may take after they have perceived the intervention - that is, all the possible interaction paths arising from the intervention.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        The physical or emotional state of the user after they have (i) perceived the intervention and (ii) taken an action in response to the intervention. This may include a description of any changes to the user's assets, i.e. <em>"the user will have allowed the platform access to their cookies."</em>
                                                    </li>

                                                    <li>
                                                        Who benefits from the outcome of the design intervention - is it the user, platform or both?

                                            Points two and three on the list refer to the <em>post-conditions</em> of the intervention, both in terms of the user's state and the sysem's state. It is vital to consider both, as many unethical interventions have deeply troubling impacts on the 
                                            emotional wellbeing of the user, as will be explored further in the next chapter.

                                            Once a design intervention has been thoroughly documented according to the template above, the focus may shift towards its ethical dimension. One of the most important factors to consider is the perceivability of an
                                            intervention, or the extent to which users can recognise its existence and identify its action possibilities. Interventions which are not perceivable are covert, and operate below the threshold of the user's perception - this 
                                            has the potential to be abused, if the goal of the intervention is to get the user to spend money or relinquish data. If the user is not aware that the design intervention is operating, they will be more likely to fall prey to 
                                            malicious interventions, of which dark patterns are a subset.

                                        <p>
                                            Similarly, the extent to which users can successfuly identify all possible actions is also a part of perceivability - many dark patterns operate by restricting the set of available options to users and forcing them towards
                                            actions that financually benefit the platform. By using visual interference, many design interventions successfuly conceal action possibilities from the user, hence creating a disparity between what the user <em>perceives</em>
                                            is available to them options-wise, and what is actually present.

                                        <p>
                                            The following guidelines should be considered when analysing a design intervention - the more transparent and less covert an intervention, the less likely it is to be unethical. Of course, many dark patterns such as confirmshaming
                                            are fully perceivable, however, the likelihood of a user falling prey to a perceivable dark pattern is far lower than if the pattern was covert, as the user would recognise it and take actions against it.

This may involve either user intuition, or explicitly informing the user of an intervention's purpose (e.g. <em>"We've set your default settings to X, Y and Z to maximise playback quality."</em>)

                                            Perceivability is an excellent way to ensure the quality of a design intervention and can provide a blueprint for user testing. The concepts listed above closely relate to Norman's concepts of the 
                                            gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation, as they focus on the gap between what the user expects from an interface, and what the interface delivers in practice.

                                            The final technique that will be discussed in this chapter is <strong>scenario realism</strong>, a thought-experiment like process which can often help identify unethical design interventions. 
                                            The aim of scenario realism is to break the technological barrier, so to speak. A consequence of technology is that we cannot see or speak to the users interacting with our systems, making it
                                            difficult to empathise with the individual user on the other end of the website. Scenario realism, quite simply, involves considering a design intervention in multiple contexts and from multiple points of view - 
                                            while it is not as precise or formal as the approach to perceivability described above, it can be very effective.

                                            <p>The first step in practising scenario realism is considering the ethics of a design intervention if it were conducted independently of technology - that is, between two, face-to-face people.</p>

                                            <p class ="leader text-muted"><em>For every intervention that the user encounters, imagine a comparable offline scenario. If, in a context without the technology the scenario would be deemed unethical, then its inclusion in the system is also likely to be unethical.</em></p>
                                        
                                            <p> Furthermore, scenario realism entails empathy, and viewing users not as a faceless mass, but as everyday people who may be our friends or relatives. If you, your mother or father encountered this particular intervention while they were using a website, how would you feel?  
                                                This is a general thought experiment as opposed to a detailed methodology for ethical review, but it can be effective. If you wouldn't want a loved one to come across a particular intervention, consider why. Is it likely to upset them? Will it lead to them spending more money than they intend? 
                                                Your user group will consist of many people just like your mother and father, so if an intervention would negatively impact your parents, you shouldn't subject your users to it either.

                                            The process of documenting and analysing design interventions will now be illustrated with a practical example. The technique of <strong>confirmshaming</strong> is a well known dark pattern which uses 
                                            manipulative or shaming language to steer users towards a particular choice. The example shown below is a popup intervention which uses confirmshaming, and is aimed at getting the user to sign up to a newsletter.
                                        </p>

                                        <div class = "figure d-flex justify-content-center" style = "padding-top:30px; padding-bottom:30px;">
                                            <img src="../images/intro/confirmshaming.png" style = "width:70%" class="figure-img img-fluid img-thumbnail" alt="navbar annotations" >
                                        </div>

                                        <p>The popup consists of a number of sub-interventions, which will all be analysed over the course of deconstructing it. A combination of text elements and buttons are used to create the intervention, each fulfiling a sub-goal 
                                            that ultimately contributes to the final goal of the popup itself. Below, the table summarises the motivation-method-outcome analysis of this particular
                                            design intervention. Tabulating the analysis is advised, since it is a clear and simple way of documenting the different sections.

                                                                The staff member accuses the customer of not wanting to save money and seems visibly irritated if the customer declines.

                                            The above offers a simple example of documenting and deconstructing a design intervention, before subjecting it to some ethical review. The example of confirmshaming is fully perceivable, yet still unethical due to its violation of the scenario realism 
                                            principle. This illustrates that no one metric is sufficient for judging the ethical quality of an intervention, and that a combination of many are required to assess this from different angles. In following chapters, you will be introduced to a range of other principles of ethical design; some will aid the process of
                                            user research, while others will allow you to evaluate specific design interventions.
