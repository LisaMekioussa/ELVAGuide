                                                The process of interface design should be user-centered, aiming to meet the needs of the most inexperienced end user.

                                            The principle of non-instrumentalism promotes an empathetic view towards users, framing them as individuals interacting with a system, rather than a mere extension of that system. 
                                            This necessitates a detailed focus on user experience, taking into consideration a user's goals, their expectations of the interface and its components, their prior knowledge of the system, their reactions,
                                            their vulnerabilities, and any assets they may wish to protect throughout the interaction. In doing so, it becomes easier to envision and mitigate potential unethical outcomes  that may arise from a design.
                                        </p>

                                            End users are commonly understood to be the operators of a particular system website. Via an interface, the user will communicate with the back-end system in such a way that allows them to achieve a specific goal. 
                                            A user could be anyone - depending on how and to whom the system it is deployed, users could vary from average Internet users with little to no technical knowledge to professionals in specialised fields. As such, to ensure a non-instrumentalist approach, care must be taken to profile user groups and understand their specific usability needs.  
                                        </p>

                                            To design with non-instrumentalism in mind is to design for users rather than KPIs, understanding that the key to long term economic success is a loyal userbase. Dark patterns degrade user loyalty and fundamentally harm the relationship
                                            between Internet users and web interfaces, marring perceptions and degrading trust. It is crucial to understand the value in developing websites that are not only free of dark patterns, but accessible, and not biased towards any one user group.

In practice, implementing non-instrumentalism spans many stages of the design process, from market research and to requirements elicitation to the process of prototyping and testing.
                                            If for instance, the interface to be developed is a clothing store app, the development process should begin with <strong>user research</strong> and a concrete attempt to profile the likely user groups of the application. Generally, this should be conducted qualitatively, through interviews, focus groups and surveys and serves the 
                                            purpose of setting the groundwork for the system's requirements. By premising the development of the system on fulfiling the needs of users, an instrumentalist approach is avoided from the very beginning.

                                            The process of user research is vital to the user-centeredness of a website. Often, a website will have a target demographic that may be prioritised over the course of user research; for instance, if you are designing a university course webpage, it is necessary
                                            to first ensure the students and staff of that particular university have their usability needs met, before branching out into less frequent user groups. However, many websites have a far broader reach, and the designers of such platforms
                                            find themselves in a situation where <em>everyone is the user.</em> That is, their userbase is comprised of individuals of all ages, genders, backgrounds and abilities.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When it comes to platforms that serve wide user groups, it is impossible to enumerate and profile all possible types of user and indeed - this would be undesirable. Overprofiling may lead to difficulties in designing a website that suits the needs of users generally,
                                            with it instead being overfitted to very specific cross sections of the userbase. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Instead, it is a good idea to gather a rough estimate of the different user groups, and equally represent these groups in the test sample. Generally, it is recommended that if your application spans different user groups, between 4-5 test subjects <strong>from each group</strong> should
                                            be recruited to test prototypes, or surveyed. Thus, if your application consists of three key user groups, any testing or user research procedure should involve approximately 15 users, equally divided amonst the three groups. 
                                        </p>


                                        <h3 id = "item-21" style = "font-weight:300;"> User Groups </h3>

                                            In order to test users from different groups, it is necessary to first identify what these groups are. Discovering different types of user groups is challenging, and requires some creativity and research. A solely demographic oriented approach may miss important user groups: if your user testing process for a shopping app splits users by age group but does not consider frequency of use, there may be crucial insights missed.
                                            The needs of frequent users vary wildly from the needs of occasional users, so simply considering age and other related demographics as the main contributing factors to a user's experience results in overfitting the design to be suitable for those specific demographical fluctations.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As such, a combination of <strong>behavioural and demographic</strong> audience differentiators are recommended by the Nielsen Norman Group, to identify users based on factors such as age, and on more behaviour oriented factors such as goal orientation. Some examples of useful differentiators are given below:
                                        </p>
                                        <div class = "list-eg ">
                                            <div class = "example-content  d-flex align-items-center">
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <strong>Frequency of Use:</strong> A major factor that can be used to separate an audience is how often they are likely to, or already use the system being developed. It may even be useful to consider users with no
                                                        prior experience of the system, to gague it's learnability.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <strong>Likelihood of Use: </strong>It is also possible to divide an audience based on how likely they are to make use of an application - for instance, a Satnav app is more likely to be used by people who own cars than people who do not.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <strong>Goal Orientation: </strong> Users can be divided based on whether the task offered by the application is inherently more important to certain users. For instance, a person with diabetes may be more motivated to a use a diet-tracking app
                                                        as they are motivated by the goal of keeping track of their food intake.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <strong>Domain Knowledge: </strong> Some users may inherently know more about the topic or domain of the website, affecting their interactions with the system. For instance, a chef will know more about recipes and preparing food than a non-chef, making their likely interactions
                                                        with a recipe app different.
                                                    </li>
                                                </ol>
                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>
                                            These represent simple starting points for discovering user groups, but in reality, the sky is the limit. It is important that once the groups have been identified, that a cut-off point for membership of each group is established. Age is very straightforward, but with behavioural differentiators such as frequency of use, it is necessary to determine what constitutes 
                                            <em>frequent use</em> and how users are to be split. This can be done quantitatively, or more anecdotally - e.g. users that visit a site more than twice a week are frequent users.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class = "group text-justify">

                                                <h2> UX Mapping </h2>

                                                Once data has been gathered on users, it is necessary to aggregate this data into overarching user profiles. Generally, this should be done at least once at the very beginning of the design process as a part of
                                                requirements elicitation, although frequent reviews are encouraged. Developing profiles for groups of users can aid the processes of scenario mapping and internal testing, as it converts large user groups into
                                                actors who can be considered individually. Two very useful exercises that aid the process of user profiling are <em>user personas</em>, <em>scenario maps</em> and <em>empathy maps</em>.

                                                By considering accessibility needs in particular, it becomes possible to anticipate a wider range of outcomes for specific design interventions, and catch unethical or undesirable outcomes for users.

                                                    Scenario mapping is a process of task analysis that maps out the story of a particular user on a website. Generally, it involves a description of several scenarios which together, form a description of the user's journey.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Scenarios may be thought of as informal use-cases, which include the <em>who, what, when, where, why and how</em> of system usage. An example scenario includes a user purchasing a return train ticket from an online ticketing
                                                    platform, or a user deleting their account. Scenario mapping can help to describe the flow of system use from the perspective of a user, helping to anticipate their goals, how they use the interface to achieve them and any problems they may
                                                    encounter. Once the process of user profiling has been complete, it is prudent to conduct scenario mapping on each persona developed, to understand how different user groups will use the system depending on their motivations, goals and 
                                                    frequencies of system use. One actor should be used per map to provide a clear and focused narrative.

                                                <p>
                                                    It is generally best to perform scenario mapping with colour coded post-it notes, and rows which represent different channels of consideration.

                                                        <li><strong>Questions: </strong> Things to consider when the user performs actions - potential outcomes or complexities that may arise.</li>
                                                        <li><strong>Comments: </strong> General comments on actions, such as goals of the platform or usability considerations</li>
                                                        <li><strong>Ideas </strong> Possible implementation ideas which solve questions, problems or design considerations. </li>

                                                <p> The scenario map above is very simple, but illustrates the key necessary features. It uses one actor (Jill, described in the persona above) and takes into consideration her need to save money and time to map an ideal journey through the website, flagging any challenges
                                                    which may arise throughout. While the scenario map is very useful for sketching the key use-cases of the website and predicting the primary interaction paths of different user groups, it does not ential a great focus on the user's internal thoughts and feelings throughout their
                                                    site use. Considering the user's felt experience of a website is key to ensuring it is ethical, as the majority of unethical design interventions induce negative emotions for users. Ensuring that the emotions of users are considered throughout the design process makes it less likely that an
                                                    intervention will affect them negatively in this way. Here is where <em>empathy maps</em> come into play.

                                                An empathy map is similar to a user persona,but  with a specific focus on the felt experience of users. Empathy mapping is a very simple exercise which can be used over the course of user profiling, or applied to specific scenarios or design interventions.

                                            <p> Like scenario maps, empathy maps have a simple and tabular structure which is suitable for post-it notes. The empathy map consists of four key sections, relating to what the user does, thinks, says and feels. A basic template for an empathy map is shown below.</p>

                                                    <li><strong>Says:</strong> This quadrant consists of quotes from users that have been taken from interviews, focus groups or other usability evaluations. This will be out-loud statements such as <em>"I want to be sure my details are safe."</em></li>
                                                    <li><strong>Thinks: </strong> This quadrant contains the possible thoughts of users during the experience - it represents statements the user may have felt were inappropriate to say out loud or were reluctant to share. This may include anxieties such as <em>"Do they think I'm stupid?"</em> or frustrations such as <em>"This is really annnoying."</em> 
                                                    <li><strong>Does: </strong> The physical actions that users take during an interaction, such as clicking a link several times or hitting the back button.</li>
                                                    <li><strong>Feels: </strong> This quadrant contains information on the emotional constitution of the user, with an adjective and a justification. For instance, an entry may be <em>Stressed: the user did not want the item to run out of stock before they purchased it.</em> </li>
                                                    <li><strong>Goals:</strong> A summary of the user's overarching goals for a particular interaction. These can be very broad, such as <em>purchase an item</em> or more specific, such as <em>compare the prices of two items.</em></li>
                                                    <li><strong>Problems:</strong> Any pain points the user encounters - issues that either cause them stress, frustration or impede their ability to meet goals.</li>

                                                Used together, empathy and scenario mapping are simple and powerful ways to determine key the use-cases of an interface, alongside the corresponding user actions and reactions, both verbal and non-verbal. Empathy in UX design requires comprehensive user research and profliling, combined with a design process that places the users and their goals at the center of the 
                                                design. Design which boosts KPIs by impeding the user's ability to complete their goals is not simply unethical: it is fundamentally poor UX. From this chapter, you have hopefully seen that good UX necessitates ethical design and vice versa. This chapter concludes with the following thought:
