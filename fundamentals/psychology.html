                                            When designing with user cognition and perception in mind, it is vital to use psychological insight honestly and with the goal of helping or passively persuasing the user,
                                            rather than exploiting their cognitive biases for the gain of the platform.

                                            The relationship between cognitive psychology and interaction design is longstanding. Designing effective, engaging interfaces requires an in depth understanding of the human mind, 
                                            making psychological insight the most powerful weapon in any designer's arsenal.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class = "text-justify">
                                            <em>Application of psychological insight</em> can be briefly summarised as as designing a feature that exploits some known psychological property, often with the aim of eliciting some response or behaviour from the user. 
                                            The process of applying psychological insight has three main constituents: the desired outcome (for instance, convincing a user to choose one option over another), the psychological or perceptive property itself and the specific way in which this property informs a design decision.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3 id = "item-11" style = "font-weight:300;">A Simple Example</h3>
                                        <p class = "text-justify"> A common goal of UX designers is to convey information to web users such that it sticks and motivates them to make decisions. This, therefore is the <strong>intended outcome</strong>. Now, we possess a number of psychological quirks that affect the absorption and retention of information delivered to us online. 
                                            The most famous example, uncovered in a study conducted by the Nielsen Normal group, is that <em>people do not read, they skim content.</em> It can therefore be deduced that important information, if buried in a block of text will likely not be picked up by the user, making this the <strong> psychological property exploited by the design.</strong>
                                            As such, the designer may decide to present textual information briefly and concisely, using bullet points and an increased font size to draw attention to important points. 
                                        </p>

                                        <p class = "text-justify"> In this case, the psychological insight is applied <strong> honestly.</strong> It is applied to aid rapid comprehension of the text and will likely result in the user finding the information they need more quickly. However, it is also possible to use psychological properties to deceive the user, or to hide important
                                            information from them, as many dark patterns do. In this case, if a designer wished to hide certain stipulations from the user, which if perceived, would affect their decision to buy a product, it would be easy to do this. The designer would simply deliver the information as dense prose text and bury the stipulations in a paragraph, making the likelihood of the user
                                            reading it very low. In this case, application of psychological insight is applied <strong>deceptively.</strong>

                                            The above table gives example of two ways in which human cognition can be used either honestly or deceptively. In reality, there are infinitely many properties that can be exploited by malicious design interventions - the two most important ones are <strong>cognitive biases</strong>
                                            and the <strong>dual process model</strong>, both of which will be discussed in this chapter. The majority of dark patterns leverage one or more of these properties, and by learning about how they operate, you will likely become more adept at spotting them in designs.

                                        Humans possess two main modes of decision making - System 1, which is quicker and more impusive and System 2, which is slower and more measured.

                                            The dual process model states that there are two main systems operating when we make decisions. This model, which underpins much of modern cognitive psychology research, states that the brain makes a distinction between decisions that are automatic and quick, and decisions that are slower, requiring more conscious thought.
                                            Kahenman, in his 2012 book <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> refers to these modes of cognitive operation as System 1 and System 2 respectively. System 1 operates unconsciously, and is responsible for “originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the  explicit  beliefs  and  deliberate  choices  of  System  2.”

                                            Examples of actions which largely involve System 1 include answering 2 + 2, or recognising that one object is more distant than another. System 2 actions include telling someone your phone number, or looking for a woman with white hair in a crowd. The key differences between System 1 and System 2 are summarised in the following table:

                                        There are times where making rapid, efficient decisions is necessary, but there also scenarios where acting on impulse may result in an undesirable outcome. For instance, rushing to accept the terms and conditions of an agreement without reading them in detail is a System 1 decision, but in reality it ought to involve System 2.

                                    <h3 id = "item-21">Using the Dual Process Model in Designs</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The dual process model can be used to inform design interventions, in contexts where it is appropriate to consider how users will likely make a decision. The examples below show two homepage designs for a website selling home security systems. The first
                                        is largely tailored to System 1, presenting information immediately and requiring little cognitive effort from the user. The second design is more tailored to a System 2 mode of decision making, as it requires users to actively read and synthesise the information they see. 
                                    </p>
                                    <div class = "figure mx-auto" style = "padding-bottom:40px;padding-top:20px">
                                            <img src="../images/psych/systemone.PNG" class=" img-thumbnail figure-img img-fluid" alt="Bookstore annotation" style = "width:100%; height:52%;padding-right:10px;">
                                            <p class = "mx-auto annotations" >
                                                    This is a System 1 based approach: the amount of text presented to the user initially is kept to a minimum and the information that is presented uses persuasive language and places emphasis on the company phone number. 
                                                    This is designed to exploit System 1, capturing the user's attention enough to trigger a phone call.
                                            </p>
                                    </div>
                                    
                                    <div class = "figure mx-auto" style = "padding-bottom:40px;padding-top:20px">
                                            <img src="../images/psych/systemtwo.PNG" class="img-thumbnail figure-img img-fluid" alt="Bookstore annotation" style = "width:100%; height:55%;padding-right:10px;">
                                            <p class = "mx-auto annotations" >
                                                This interface presents a larger quantity of information to the user, therefore requiring more initial cognitive effort. This largely appeals to System 2, as the user is required to read the information presented to 
                                                them and select the most relevant details.
                                            </p>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>
                                            The link between the dual process model and ethics is significant, as it places users in a position of vulnerability. Arguably, some responsibility falls onto the users to carefully read terms and conditions and ensure they do not consent to anything without realising.
                                            However, this does not remove the fact that deliberately designing an intervention to hide information or exploiting the fact that users often act without thinking, is unethical. Designers should bear the dual process model in mind, and ensure that users are fully aware of the consequences
                                            of their actions even when using system 1.

                                                    System 1 is very easily exploited by dark patterns and unethical design interventions. Visual interference, hidden costs and hidden stipulations in particular, operate by sneaking small bits of information past the user as described in the introduction.

It implements several techniques to make the content more accessible to readers wishing to complete their tasks quickly:

                                                <li>Ensures that the content is summarised in bullet points near the top, such that the user can access a minimal summary of information without having to scroll. More detail is availible should they seek it, however.</li>
                                                <li>Uses inline <code>.strong</code> typography to make important points stand out to the user.</li>

                                        The second example presents how the dual process model can be used deceptively, to conceal undesirable stipulations in a large, inaccessible block of text. Naturally, the text given in the above example is dummy text but in practice, such poor designs are often accompanied with very technically worded writing that few users understand without reference to legal documentation.

                                            The Framing Effect

                                        <p class = "lead">
                                            The framing effect states that people's decisions significantly based on how information is presented to them, through wording or context. Peple rely more on the framing than the actual facts themselves, and this can lead to bias or poor long term decisions.
                                        </p>
                                        

                                        <p>
                                            The framing effect links into another popular theory known as loss aversion, which states that people tend to compulsively avoid outcomes they perceive as losses. Famously, this principle is demonstrated by a simple experimental result: most people would prefer not to lose £5 than potentially gain
                                            £5. Phrases such as <em>"Don't miss out!</em> Loss aversion and framing effects are usually leveraged through the text and language used by a website. For instance, in the example of confirmshaming presented in chapter X, the option to reject the popup was framed in such a way that made the user feel as though doing so was a poor decision. 
                                            In this context, using the framing effect to achieve this goal is unethical, as it involves evoking guilt in users.

                                        <p>
                                        The framing effect is not inherently unethical, as it does not necessarily involve mistruth - it simple reshapes facts and presents them in such a way that they are perceived as desirable. It can be used for good: for instance, it was found in one study that women were more likely to self-examine for breast cancer symptoms if the negative effecs of <strong>not</strong>
                                        doing so were stressed, rather than the positive effects of doing so. The positive framing was as follows:
                                        </p>

                                        <p class = "lead"><em>"Research shows that women who do BSE have an increased chance of finding a tumour in the early, more treatable stages of the disease."</em></p>
                                        
                                        <p> And the same information, but framed negatively was as follows:</p>

                                        <p class = "lead">
                                            <em>
                                                "Research shows that women who do not do BSE have a decreased chance of finding a tumour in the early, more treatable stages of the disease."
                                            </em>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This particular type of negative framing proved more effective in encouraging breast self-examination (BSE), despite the statements being semantically equivalent.
                                        </p>

                                            An example from of framing as used on a web interface is Facebook's <em>find friends</em> dialog, which attempts to persuade the user to find more friends via their email. The dialog uses both social proof and the framing effect, as it implies that other users benefit from finding friends, and that not finding friends will result in Facebook being less fun. Depending on whether the 
                                            claim that <em>"people usually find up to 20 friends"</em> is accurate, this design intervention is not remarkably unethical. Despite being persuasive, it does not attempt to directly induce guilt or shame in the user, but rather highlights the benefits of performing one action over another.

Using double negatives is a common way to frame information in a confusing way.

                                        </h3>
                                        <p class = "lead">
                                            The default effect refers to the general tendency of people to prefer an option if it has been chosen by default, regardless of whether it is logically the best choice. Less than 5% of users change their default settings on websites, so choosing appropriate defaults is important.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            There are two main factors behind the default effect - the desire for interfaces to "do the thinking for us" and the perception that default options are better for us, as they have been chosen by the platform. The latter implies a level of trust in the platform, as users trust its authority to select an option that benefits the user. While the ethics of defaults will be described further in later chapters,
                                            it can be said that they are very useful in contexts where processes should be streamlined for non-technical users, such as account setup or settings configuration.

                                            Having a "recommended" set of settings for general users, while offering more technical users the opportunity to change these defaults can provide users who may be confused as to which options to choose with a sense of stability and security. 
                                            
                                        </p>

                                            This example from Dropbox's setup wizard illustrates how the default effect can lead users towards an option that is simpler for them. The average user will have a limited knowledge of Advanced Settings and may initially be confused as to which 
                                            option they should select. Preselecting a default removes this confusion.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                Users should be able to intuitively understand why a particular option has been pre-selected for them. In the case where this is not possible, it should be explained to them.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            However, pre-selecting options for users comes with a dark flipside. Given that it is a well known fact that users, will stick with default options, could it be possible for designers to pre-select options that benefit the platform at the expense of the user? The answer to this question is absolutely - <em>bad defaults</em>
                                            work in exactly this way, and preselects default options that steer users towards more expensive options, or options that cause them to relinquish more data. Often, these bad defaults are combined with restrictive dark patterns, which in addition to selecting unethical default settings, make it doubly difficult for users to change these defaults.
                                            An example of a <strong>bad default</strong> is shown below.

                                            Sunk cost refers to the tendency to continue with a course of action if significant effort has already been expended to complete it. The effort already put into the task is perceived as lost if the task is abandoned.

                                            Phrases such as <em>"you've come too far to give up now"</em> perfectly embody the sunk cost fallacy. While this particular cognitive bias has its uses, its tendency to cause people to commit to failing courses of action 
                                            renders it particularly dangerous. Fundamentally, the sunk cost fallacy involves valuing past expenditures over what is actually beneficial in the future, and can be used quite deviously by unethical design interventions.

This abuses the fact that they will not want to waste the effort they have already put in, and unfairly nudges them towards options they may not otherwise have taken had they been given all of the relevant information earlier.

                                            primarily serve the purpose of notifying the user of how far along they are in a process. By showing them their progress, this also wields the dual effect of making them less likely to give up on their task as their progress is

                                            People are more likely to perform an action or believe a claim if others have already done so. This links very closely to the marketing tactic of <em>social proof,</em> 
                                            which involves publicly displaying information about customer purchases, such as the number of people who have a purchased a particular product, in an attempt to convince
                                            others to purchase it as well.

                                            The concept of value lies at the heart of the bandwagon effect. The more popular a product is, the more valuable it will seem; by signalling to users that other customers have found value in a product, the perceived value of the produce increases.
                                            Humans are social creatures, and will always use the opinions of others to inform their purchasing decisions. This has a number of applications in both online marketing and beyond.

                                            Perhaps the most powerful application of the bandwagon effect is to <strong> review systems for products on e-commerce websites.</strong> Implementing social proof honestly (that is displaying information accurately and without bias), while harnessing the potential to persuade users, harnesses an equivalent power to dissuade. User ratings and testimonials are common examples of social proof; by granting users the freedom to publish reviews, the platform must accept the risk that these reviews will not always be positive.
                                            User reviews, while often intended as a marketing strategy, promote a number of positive ethical values, such as trust and a sense of community. Social proof nudges have traditionally been used for good, in the context of environmental conservation but these techniques have recently been repurposed to guilt individuals into purchasing items, or mislead them with fabricated information.

                                            Similar to the bandwagon effect, scarcity bias refers to the tendency for people to place greater value in things that are viewed as scarce or rare, over objects that are abundant.

Diamond's scarcity makes it more difficult to acquire and in the minds of human beings, this correlates to a greater value. This example perfectly illustrates the scarcity bias: the tendency for humans to desire objects that are scarce over objects that are abundant.

                                            The most common exploitation of this heuristic in UX design is in relation to sales, when an item is displayed as low in stock or an offer is described as ending soon. Greater value is placed on items that are low in supply due to the principle of social proof, the perception that a low-stock item must be more popular and therefore of higher value than an item high in stock. The user also wishes to avoid missing out on obtaining this precious resource and mitigate any possible future regret they may feel for not purchasing it.

                                                <li>Quantity limited scarcity is similarly implemented by displaying generic low stock messages that do not indicate whether an item will be re-stocked soon, hence possibly inducing unnecessary anxiety in the user.</li>
